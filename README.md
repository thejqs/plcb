PLCB unicorns
=============
Pennsylvania is a control state when it comes to adult beverages. It hires the administrative and retail employees, it selects the products, it stores and ships them, it controls point-of-sale transactions.

It's generally terrible for consumers. We have to drive to Ohio or Maryland or wherever for even some basics, some staples. **But it works out pretty well when one wants a bunch of data about booze.**

Also terrible: the interface(s) the state puts on the data. No joke.

I can't search it like I'd want. So I guess I have to go get the data.

**Good thing I can write code.**

This project exists to collect and illuminate all of the products available for sale in only one store -- one of 597 stores, to be precise -- the state runs across Pennsylvania. The unicorns, as it were. My inspiration for this came from writing [this story](http://www.post-gazette.com/life/libations/2015/03/04/A-Croatia-to-Pittsburgh-wine-odyssey-How-an-obscure-bottle-gets-in-the-PLCB-system/stories/201503040013).

The state's database can do this, but the existing interfaces won't let me. There's no API. So here we are.

The state's database conveniently updates at the close of business each day. So at least one of the scripts in the project might end up doing the same.

Until then: *On Python!* *On JavaScript!*

Let's do this.
